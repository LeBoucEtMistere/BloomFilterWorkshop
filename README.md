# Rust 101 Workshop : build a bloom filter

This Repo contains the content for a Rust 101 Workshop I'm giving at my company. It aims at being beginner friendly and not expecting any prior knowledge on the Rust language. The goal is to be very hands-on so the core project for this workshop is to build a Bloom Filter implementation in Rust and eventually expose it through a Python library.
